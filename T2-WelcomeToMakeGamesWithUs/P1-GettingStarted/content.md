Those were made by high school students! They learned through our tutorials and you will too. Our last project has you clone Angry Birds. That means you'll know how to make games that are at least as complicated as Angry Birds by the end of this!

Our tutorials assume you have basic experience in object oriented programming and you'll need a Mac to install the required software. 

Once you've finished the tutorials and have started making your own game, you can publish it with us. We'll do all the art and music for your game, publish it to the App Store, promote it, and give you 70% of the revenues!
